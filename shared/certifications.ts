// Certification levels and the badges earned by completing them.
//
// A certification belongs to a DEPARTMENT (a free-text name matching
// `team_settings.departments`, or `null` for the "General" category) and a
// LEVEL, 1..MAX_LEVEL. Together those form a track: "Manufacturing Lvl 1" ->
// "Manufacturing Lvl 2" -> ... Completing every certification in one
// (department, level) set earns the badge for that set.
//
// Levels are SEQUENTIAL: a student can't start a Lvl N certification until
// they hold the Lvl N-1 badge for that same department. The gate reads the
// RECORDED badge rather than recomputing "do they hold every Lvl N-1 cert
// right now" — see `isLevelUnlocked` for why that distinction matters.
//
// This module is pure and dependency-free (no import from ./schema) so it can
// be shared verbatim between the client and server, and unit-tested with no
// database — see server/certifications.test.ts.
